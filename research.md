**Summary of research interests:**

* high-dimensional data analysis
* time Series analysis
* statistical/machine learning
* computational statistics
* graphical mdoels

My research interests are at the intersection of applied, computational and theoretical statistics. 
Being statistician with BS in Computer Science and Master in Economics, I enjoy solving applied problems which  lead to improving 
existing statistical methodologies. I beleive every high-dimensional data has undelying  scientifically meaningful low-dimensional structures
and one of my primary goal is to assisit in identifying and descovering this structure.
I am convinced that in nowdays fast growing world, collaboration with within and outside 
field scientists is essential in achieving this goal.

THe methodologies I am interested in are in the areas of high diemsnioanl time series analysis, machine learning and optimization. 
The classical covariance estimation in multivariate and time series analysis perform poorly when applied to modern datasets due to the 
presence of more variables then observations. 
I am interested in addressing these problems jointly in the high-dimensional settings by developing new statistical methodology that is
both computationally efficient and theoretically sound. I have found that penalization techniques and the tools of convex optimization 
are particularly useful in achieving this goal.

I have worked on a variety of applied problems such as discovering the underlying structure in food recalls, high dimensional financial datasets 
and call center data.
My methodological work has been strongly motivated by these applied projects and I am looking forward to new collaborations in the future.
